Guess-the-Card
==============

A standard 52-card guessing game in Java

This game randomly chooses a suit and value then prompts players to guess what suit and value have been chosen. If the suit is incorrect, users can guess just the suit again. If the value is incorrect, the game tells the player whether their guess was too high or too low. If both are wrong, the player is prompted to guess both again. The game stops when the suit and value have both been guessed correctly.
